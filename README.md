# windows-terminal-icons

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is great, but when building profiles it doesn't provide default icons for profiles. This repo is created to solve this issue. MS @DHowett-MSFT doesn't seem to understand this is an extremely simple feature to implement. An enum for example would be super easy to give users, debian, ubuntu, raspberry, etc. One argument in the below issue was the the paths might change, and that's fine do whatever you want with the internal paths just expose default icons to the user. A new profile build shouldn't take 10min building a json + looking for an icon.

- Get higher resolution for some
